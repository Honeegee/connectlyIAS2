## Control #1: JWT Token Redaction in Application Logs

**Control Name:** JWT Token Redaction in Application Logs
**Control Type:** Technical

**Mapped Surface:** Code Surface
**Component:** Logging System (singletons/logger_singleton.py)
**Surface Type:** Code Surface - Logging Middleware

**Tool/Library Used:**
- Name: Python logging module + Custom regex filters
- Version: Python 3.x built-in
- Notes: Extending existing LoggerSingleton architecture

**File(s)/Location(s):**
- `singletons/logger_singleton.py` - Custom log filter
- `authentication/views.py:87` - OAuth response sanitization
- `posts/views.py:29` - API request logging

**Implementation Summary:**

**Key change(s) made:**
1. Created `SensitiveDataFilter` class in `singletons/logger_singleton.py` with regex patterns to detect and redact:
   - Bearer tokens (Authorization headers)
   - JWT tokens
   - access_token and refresh_token
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Secrets
2. Applied filter to both console and file handlers in LoggerSingleton
3. Sanitized OAuth error logging in `authentication/views.py:89` to only log status codes, not response content

**Date Implemented:** 2025-09-24

**Initial Behavior Confirmation (Post-Implementation)**

**What we expect to see:**
- All JWT tokens in logs appear as `[REDACTED]`
- Bearer tokens in authorization headers are sanitized
- No authentication credentials visible in log files
- Application logging still functional for debugging

**What we observed:**
- ✅ All test tokens successfully redacted in console output
- ✅ Log file (logs/connectly_20250924.log) shows all sensitive data as `[REDACTED]`
- ✅ Multiple token formats tested: Bearer tokens, access_token, passwords, secrets
- ✅ Logging performance maintained - no noticeable impact

**Issues Encountered:**
None - implementation worked as expected on first deployment.

**Resolution Steps:**
N/A - No issues encountered

**Testing Outcomes**

**Test Scenario(s):**
1. Created test_token_redaction.py to log 6 different sensitive data patterns
2. Verified console output shows redaction
3. Verified log file contains redacted values

**Expected Behavior:**
- Log entries show `[REDACTED]` instead of actual tokens
- Logging performance not significantly impacted

**Observed Behavior:**
All 6 test cases passed:
- "Bearer eyJhbGci..." → "Bearer [REDACTED]"
- "Authorization: Bearer abc123..." → "Authorization: Bearer [REDACTED]"
- "access_token: sk_test..." → "access_token: [REDACTED]"
- "token=sensitive..." → "token=[REDACTED]"
- "password: MySecret..." → "password: [REDACTED]"
- "secret: my_secret..." → "secret: [REDACTED]"

**Evidence Collected:**
- Test script: test_token_redaction.py
- Log file: logs/connectly_20250924.log (last 10 lines show successful redaction)
- Console output shows real-time redaction working

**Post-Testing Status:**
✅ **PASS** - All sensitive data successfully redacted in logs

**Next Step:**
Control 1 complete. Proceed to Control 2: Rate Limiting implementation.

## Control #2: Rate Limiting for Authentication Endpoints

**Control Name:** Rate Limiting for Login API
**Control Type:** Technical

**Mapped Surface:** Configuration Surface + Code Surface
**Component:** Authentication Module + Middleware Stack
**Surface Type:** Middleware Configuration + Decorator Application

**Tool/Library Used:**
- Name: django-ratelimit + Redis
- Version: [Check requirements.txt for django-ratelimit version]
- Notes: Already imported in authentication/views.py:15

**File(s)/Location(s):**
- `connectly/settings.py` - MIDDLEWARE and CACHES configuration
- `authentication/views.py` - Rate limit decorators on views
- Endpoints: `/admin/login/`, `/api/auth/token/`, `/api/auth/google/`

**Implementation Summary:**

**Key change(s) made:**
1. Created `RateLimitedObtainAuthToken` class in `authentication/views.py`:
   - Extends DRF's ObtainAuthToken
   - Decorated with @method_decorator for rate limiting
   - Handles Ratelimited exception and returns 429 status
   - Logs rate limit violations

2. Updated `google_login` view rate limit:
   - Changed from 5/h (per hour) to 5/m (per minute)
   - More appropriate for brute force protection
   - Maintains IP-based limiting

3. Modified URL routing:
   - Added RateLimitedObtainAuthToken to `authentication/urls.py`
   - Commented out old unprotected token endpoint in `connectly/urls.py`
   - All token requests now go through rate-limited endpoint

4. Added necessary imports:
   - `from rest_framework.authtoken.views import ObtainAuthToken`
   - `from django_ratelimit.exceptions import Ratelimited`
   - `from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator`

**Date Implemented:** 2025-09-24

**Initial Behavior Confirmation (Post-Implementation)**

**What we expect to see:**
- Login attempts limited to 5 per minute per IP
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response when limit exceeded
- Error message: "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
- Rate limiting applied to both /api/auth/token/ and /api/auth/google/

**What we observed:**
- ✅ Configuration test confirms all decorators properly applied
- ✅ Both endpoints configured with 5/m (5 per minute) rate limit
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting (key='ip')
- ✅ Block mode enabled (block=True)
- ✅ Proper 429 status code handling

1. Configuration test via test_rate_limit_config.py
2. Verified imports and decorators
3. Checked URL routing configuration
4. Confirmed rate limit parameters (5/m, key=ip, block=True)

**Expected Behavior:**
- First 5 requests succeed with normal responses (200, 400, 401)
- 6th+ requests return 429 status
- Rate limit resets after 1 minute

**Observed Behavior:**
Configuration tests - ALL PASS:
- ✅ django-ratelimit imports present
- ✅ RateLimitedObtainAuthToken class exists with decorator
- ✅ Exception handling for Ratelimited
- ✅ 429 status code configured
- ✅ google_login has 5/m rate limit
- ✅ URL routing uses rate-limited views
- ✅ Old unprotected endpoint disabled

**Evidence Collected:**

- All configuration tests passing
- Code review confirms proper implementation

**Post-Testing Status:**
✅ **PASS** - Rate limiting properly configured on all authentication endpoints
