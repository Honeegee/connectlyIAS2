## Control #1: JWT Token Redaction in Application Logs

**Control Name:** JWT Token Redaction in Application Logs
**Control Type:** Technical

**Mapped Surface:** Code Surface
**Component:** Logging System (singletons/logger_singleton.py)
**Surface Type:** Code Surface - Logging Middleware

**Tool/Library Used:**
- Name: Python logging module + Custom regex filters
- Version: Python 3.x built-in
- Notes: Extending existing LoggerSingleton architecture

**File(s)/Location(s):**
- `singletons/logger_singleton.py` - Custom log filter
- `authentication/views.py:87` - OAuth response sanitization
- `posts/views.py:29` - API request logging

**Implementation Summary:**

**Key change(s) made:**
1. Created `SensitiveDataFilter` class in `singletons/logger_singleton.py` with regex patterns to detect and redact:
   - Bearer tokens (Authorization headers)
   - JWT tokens
   - access_token and refresh_token
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Secrets
2. Applied filter to both console and file handlers in LoggerSingleton
3. Sanitized OAuth error logging in `authentication/views.py:89` to only log status codes, not response content

**Date Implemented:** 2025-09-24

**Initial Behavior Confirmation (Post-Implementation)**

**What we expect to see:**
- All JWT tokens in logs appear as `[REDACTED]`
- Bearer tokens in authorization headers are sanitized
- No authentication credentials visible in log files
- Application logging still functional for debugging

**What we observed:**
- ✅ All test tokens successfully redacted in console output
- ✅ Log file (logs/connectly_20250924.log) shows all sensitive data as `[REDACTED]`
- ✅ Multiple token formats tested: Bearer tokens, access_token, passwords, secrets
- ✅ Logging performance maintained - no noticeable impact

**Issues Encountered:**
None - implementation worked as expected on first deployment.

**Resolution Steps:**
N/A - No issues encountered

**Testing Outcomes**

**Test Scenario(s):**
1. Created test_token_redaction.py to log 6 different sensitive data patterns
2. Verified console output shows redaction
3. Verified log file contains redacted values

**Expected Behavior:**
- Log entries show `[REDACTED]` instead of actual tokens
- Logging performance not significantly impacted

**Observed Behavior:**
All 6 test cases passed:
- "Bearer eyJhbGci..." → "Bearer [REDACTED]"
- "Authorization: Bearer abc123..." → "Authorization: Bearer [REDACTED]"
- "access_token: sk_test..." → "access_token: [REDACTED]"
- "token=sensitive..." → "token=[REDACTED]"
- "password: MySecret..." → "password: [REDACTED]"
- "secret: my_secret..." → "secret: [REDACTED]"

**Evidence Collected:**
- Test script: test_token_redaction.py
- Log file: logs/connectly_20250924.log (last 10 lines show successful redaction)
- Console output shows real-time redaction working

**Post-Testing Status:**
✅ **PASS** - All sensitive data successfully redacted in logs

**Next Step:**
Control 1 complete. Proceed to Control 2: Rate Limiting implementation.
