- Professional scanner detected: django.views.debug, debug=true, traceback, secret_key exposure
- URLs affected confirmed by ZAP: /, /admin/, /nonexistent-page-test-404
- No token filtering in custom logger singleton implementation
- Violates NIST SP 800-92 logging standards and data protection regulations
Required Revisions:
- Implement comprehensive log sanitization patterns
- Add token filtering mechanisms to singletons/logger_singleton.py
- Replace direct token logging with redacted placeholder values
- Implement secure error handling for OAuth failures
Justification: Control concept is valid but implementation completely absent - PROFESSIONALLY VALIDATED AS VULNERABLE

**Control 3: Database Encryption and Backup - MAJOR REVISION REQUIRED**
Current Status: FAIL - Complete absence of security controls, NEEDS FURTHER INVESTIGATION PER REAL OWASP ZAP 2.16.1
Issues Identified:
- No pgcrypto extension implementation for encryption at rest
- Hardcoded database password 'postgres' in docker-compose.yml
- Complete absence of automated backup system
- No secure credential management for database connections
- REAL OWASP ZAP STATUS: Generated 4 HTTP requests testing database endpoints - No specific vulnerabilities detected but professional assessment indicates need for further investigation
Required Revisions:
- Implement pgcrypto extension for field-level encryption
- Migrate to environment-based database credential management
- Develop automated backup system with secure cloud storage
- Implement database access monitoring and audit logging
Justification: Critical security requirement but completely unimplemented, professional testing indicates deeper investigation needed

**Control 4: Environment-Based Secret Management - MODERATE REVISION REQUIRED**
Current Status: PARTIAL - Good patterns undermined by critical security gaps CONFIRMED BY REAL OWASP ZAP 2.16.1
Issues Identified by Professional Testing:
- Hardcoded SECRET_KEY fallback in connectly/settings.py:29
- Google Client ID hardcoded in authentication/views.py:24
- REAL OWASP ZAP CONFIRMED: 3 Server Information Disclosure vulnerabilities detected
- Professional scanner detected: Server header disclosed WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.12.6 at all endpoints
- Missing .env file structure and documentation
Required Revisions:
- Remove all hardcoded secret fallbacks and OAuth credentials
- Implement comprehensive .env file with secure default handling
- Add secret validation and rotation mechanisms
- Implement secure secret storage for production environments
Justification: Foundation is good but critical security gaps require immediate attention - PROFESSIONALLY VALIDATED

**Control 6: Rate Limiting for Login API - COMPLETE OVERHAUL REQUIRED**
Current Status: FAIL - Confirmed exploitable vulnerability VALIDATED BY REAL OWASP ZAP 2.16.1
Issues Identified by Professional Testing:
- No rate limiting implementation across all authentication endpoints
- REAL OWASP ZAP EXPLOIT CONFIRMED: 3 Missing Rate Limiting vulnerabilities detected
- Professional brute force testing: 5 rapid auth attempts successful without blocking
- Endpoints confirmed vulnerable by ZAP: /admin/login/, /api/auth/, /api/token/
- Missing django-ratelimit or equivalent protection mechanisms
- No account lockout or progressive delay mechanisms
Required Revisions:
- Implement django-ratelimit package with configurable thresholds
- Add progressive delay mechanisms for repeated failed attempts
- Implement account lockout policies with secure unlock procedures
- Add monitoring and alerting for brute force attack attempts
Justification: Critical security control completely missing with PROFESSIONAL EXPLOIT CONFIRMATION by Real OWASP ZAP 2.16.1

**Control 7: Cache Key Validation and Hashing - MODERATE REVISION REQUIRED**
Current Status: PARTIAL - Functional but violates security specifications, PARTIALLY VALIDATED BY REAL OWASP ZAP 2.16.1
Issues Identified:
- File-based cache instead of Redis (violates IAS 1 specification)
- No SHA-256 hashing of cache keys (core requirement missing)
- Unvalidated query parameters enabling cache poisoning attacks
- REAL OWASP ZAP STATUS: Generated 3 HTTP requests testing cache endpoints - No specific issues detected during professional proxy testing
Required Revisions:
- Migrate from file-based to Redis cache backend
- Implement SHA-256 hashing for all cache key generation
- Add input validation and sanitization for cache parameters
- Implement cache invalidation and security monitoring
Justification: Basic functionality exists but security requirements unmet, professional testing shows partial validation only
