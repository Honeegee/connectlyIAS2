CONTROL 1 AUDIT: JWT TOKEN REDACTION IN LOGS
=============================================

CONTROL DETAILS:
- Type: Preventive
- Implementation: Modify logging configuration to filter/redact sensitive fields
- Cost: â‚±60,000 annually
- Standards: NIST SP 800-92, ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.12.4.1

AUTOMATED TOOL: Bandit Python Security Linter
MANUAL METHOD: Configuration Security Review & Logging Analysis

=== CRITICAL FINDING ===
LOCATION: authentication/views.py:87
CODE: logger.error(f"Failed to verify Google token: {google_response.text}")
VULNERABILITY: Google OAuth tokens exposed in error logs

=== LOGGING SYSTEM ANALYSIS ===
Logger Implementation: singletons/logger_singleton.py
- Centralized logging system exists
- File-based logging to logs/connectly_YYYYMMDD.log
- No token filtering or redaction mechanism implemented
- No sensitive data sanitization

=== BANDIT FINDINGS ===
- No direct token hardcoding issues in production code
- Test files contain expected hardcoded tokens (acceptable)
- HTTP request without timeout detected (medium severity)

=== EVIDENCE COLLECTED ===
1. bandit_full_report.json - Complete security scan results
2. Source code analysis showing token exposure in logs
3. Logging configuration review

RESULT: FAIL - Control not implemented
RISK LEVEL: CRITICAL

OBSERVATIONS:
- JWT token redaction control completely missing
- Sensitive OAuth tokens logged in plain text during errors
- No log sanitization mechanisms present
- Violates NIST SP 800-92 logging security guidelines
