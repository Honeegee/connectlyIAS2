CONTROL 3 AUDIT: DATABASE ENCRYPTION AND BACKUP
===============================================

CONTROL DETAILS:
- Area Reviewed: PostgreSQL Database Encryption (pgcrypto) and Automated Backup System Implementation
- Type: Preventive
- Implementation: PostgreSQL with pgcrypto, automated encrypted backups (AWS RDS/Oracle Cloud)
- Cost: ₱200,000 annually
- Standards: ISO/IEC 27001 data protection standards

AUTOMATED TOOL: Safety Dependency Scanner
MANUAL METHOD: Configuration Security Review

=== DATABASE CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS ===
Location: docker-compose.yml:4-13

Database Setup:
- Image: postgres:15
- Database: connectly
- User: postgres
- Password: postgres (HARDCODED - CRITICAL VULNERABILITY)
- Volume: postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

=== ENCRYPTION ASSESSMENT ===
❌ No pgcrypto extension configuration found
❌ No database-level encryption settings detected
❌ No field-level encryption implementation
❌ No encrypted volume configuration in Docker
❌ No SSL/TLS database connection configuration

=== BACKUP IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT ===
Management Commands Found:
- create_superuser.py (User management only)
- wait_for_db.py (Database readiness check only)

❌ No pg_dump backup commands
❌ No automated backup scheduling
❌ No backup encryption mechanisms
❌ No cloud backup integration (AWS RDS/Oracle Cloud)
❌ No backup retention policies
❌ No backup testing procedures

=== SAFETY DEPENDENCY SCAN RESULTS ===
File: audit_evidence/safety_dependency_scan.json
- No database encryption packages detected
- No backup automation packages found
- No pgcrypto dependencies in requirements.txt

=== CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES ===
1. Hardcoded Database Password (docker-compose.yml:11)
   - Risk: High - Default credentials exposed
   - Impact: Unauthorized database access

2. No Data Encryption at Rest
   - Risk: Critical - Sensitive data unprotected
   - Compliance: Violates ISO/IEC 27001 data protection

3. No Backup System
   - Risk: High - Data loss vulnerability
   - Business Impact: No disaster recovery capability

=== MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS ===
❌ pgcrypto extension for field-level encryption
❌ Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) configuration
❌ Encrypted database volumes
❌ Automated backup scripts with pg_dump
❌ Cloud backup integration (AWS RDS/Oracle Cloud)
❌ Backup encryption and compression
❌ Backup retention and rotation policies
❌ Database connection SSL/TLS encryption

RESULT: FAIL - Control completely unimplemented

OBSERVATIONS:
- Database encryption and backup control is entirely missing
- Critical security gap with hardcoded credentials
- No compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 data protection standards
- No disaster recovery capabilities
- High risk of data loss and unauthorized access
