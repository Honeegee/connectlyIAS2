CONTROL 2 AUDIT: ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
===================================================

CONTROL DETAILS:
- Area Reviewed: Django Permission Framework Implementation for Admin/User/Guest Roles
- Type: Preventive & Detective
- Implementation: Django permission framework with middleware-level role checks
- Cost: ₱120,000 annually
- Standards: OWASP A01:2021, ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.9.1.2, CIS Control 6.1

AUTOMATED TOOL: Django Security Check
MANUAL METHOD: API Endpoint Authorization Testing

=== ROLE DEFINITION ANALYSIS ===
Location: authentication/models.py:9-16
Roles Implemented:
- admin: Administrator (Lines 10)
- user: Regular User (Lines 11) 
- guest: Guest User (Lines 12)

Auto-Assignment Logic (Lines 24-29):
- Staff users (is_staff=True) → admin role
- Regular users → user role

=== PERMISSION CLASSES IMPLEMENTED ===
Location: posts/permissions.py

1. HasAdminRole (Lines 111-122)
   - Checks user.profile.role == 'admin' or user.is_staff
   - Returns False for unauthenticated users

2. HasUserRole (Lines 124-135)  
   - Allows 'user' and 'admin' roles
   - Excludes 'guest' users from access

3. Custom Permission Classes Found:
   - IsPostAuthor: Author-based permissions with admin override
   - CanAccessPrivatePost: Privacy-based access control
   - GuestCannotDeleteContent: Prevents guest deletions
   - AllowAnyForPublicPostsOnly: Public content access

=== VIEW-LEVEL PERMISSION ENFORCEMENT ===
Location: posts/views.py

Permission Usage:
- PostDetailView (Line 116): [AllowAnyForPublicPostsOnly, IsPostAuthor, CanAccessPrivatePost, GuestCannotDeleteContent]
- UserManagementView (Line 77): [IsAdminUser]
- PostsList (Line 336): [AllowAnyForPublicPostsOnly, IsAuthorOrReadOnly, GuestCannotDeleteContent]
- CommentManagement (Line 1045): [IsAuthenticated, IsAuthorOrReadOnly, GuestCannotDeleteContent]

=== DJANGO SECURITY CHECK RESULTS ===
File: audit_evidence/django_security_check.txt
- No RBAC-specific security warnings detected
- Permission framework properly configured

=== MANUAL AUTHORIZATION TESTING ===
Areas Tested:
1. Role Assignment: ✓ Automatic profile creation with correct roles
2. Permission Inheritance: ✓ Admin users inherit all permissions
3. Guest Restrictions: ✓ Delete operations blocked for guest users
4. Privacy Controls: ✓ Private post access limited to authors and admins

RESULT: PASS - Control properly implemented

OBSERVATIONS:
- Comprehensive 3-tier role system (admin/user/guest)
- Multiple custom permission classes for fine-grained control
- Proper admin privilege escalation
- Guest user restrictions implemented
- Privacy-based access control functional
- Exceeds IAS 1 requirements for RBAC implementation
