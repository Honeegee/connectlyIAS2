CONTROL 6 AUDIT: RATE LIMITING FOR LOGIN API
===========================================

CONTROL DETAILS:
- Area Reviewed: Authentication Endpoint Rate Limiting and Brute Force Attack Prevention Implementation
- Type: Preventive & Detective
- Implementation: Django middleware (django-ratelimit) or Cloudflare protection
- Standards: OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet, NIST SP 800-63B, CIS Control 4.6

AUTOMATED TOOL: Django Security Check
MANUAL METHOD: Authentication Flow Analysis

=== RATE LIMITING PACKAGE ANALYSIS ===
Requirements.txt scan:
❌ No django-ratelimit package found
❌ No django-rest-framework throttling packages
❌ No third-party rate limiting libraries

=== DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK THROTTLING ===
Location: connectly/settings.py:182-196

REST_FRAMEWORK configuration:
❌ No DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES configured
❌ No DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES defined
❌ No throttling policies implemented

Missing configurations:
- AnonRateThrottle for anonymous users
- UserRateThrottle for authenticated users
- LoginRateThrottle for authentication endpoints

=== MIDDLEWARE STACK ANALYSIS ===
Location: connectly/settings.py:67-78

Current middleware:
✅ SecurityMiddleware
✅ SessionMiddleware
✅ CsrfViewMiddleware
✅ AuthenticationMiddleware
❌ No rate limiting middleware

=== AUTHENTICATION ENDPOINT ANALYSIS ===
Location: authentication/views.py:61-63

Google Login Endpoint:
- Decorator: @api_view(['POST'])
- Function: google_login(request)
- Protection: ❌ NONE - No rate limiting decorators
- Vulnerability: Unlimited login attempts possible

No rate limiting on:
- /api/auth/google/ endpoint
- Token validation requests
- OAuth callback handling

=== BRUTE FORCE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT ===
Attack Vectors Identified:
1. Unlimited Google OAuth token validation attempts
2. No protection against credential stuffing
3. No account lockout mechanisms
4. No CAPTCHA implementation after failed attempts
5. No suspicious activity detection

Impact Assessment:
- Automated attacks possible against authentication endpoints
- Token validation endpoint abuse potential
- DoS attacks via unlimited authentication requests
- No protection against distributed brute force attacks

=== DJANGO SECURITY CHECK RESULTS ===
From: audit_evidence/django_security_check.txt
- No rate limiting warnings (tool doesn't check for this)
- No throttling configuration detected

=== MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS ===
❌ Django-ratelimit package installation
❌ @ratelimit decorators on authentication views
❌ DRF throttling configuration in settings
❌ Account lockout mechanisms
❌ CAPTCHA integration after multiple failures
❌ IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
❌ Login attempt monitoring and alerting

=== RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION ===
Required for compliance:
1. Install django-ratelimit package
2. Add @ratelimit(key='ip', rate='5/m') to google_login view
3. Configure DRF throttling in settings.py
4. Implement account lockout after X failed attempts
5. Add CAPTCHA integration for suspicious activity

RESULT: FAIL - Control completely unimplemented

OBSERVATIONS:
- Rate limiting control entirely missing from application
- Authentication endpoints completely vulnerable to brute force attacks
- No protection mechanisms against automated credential testing
- Critical security gap requiring immediate implementation
- Violates OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet recommendations
